# CharNet

This repository contains two implementations of character level version of generative model described in Yoshua Bengio's  [paper](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf). 

The model leverages multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) and softmax for text and sequence generation.
